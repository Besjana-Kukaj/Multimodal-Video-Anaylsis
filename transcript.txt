Hi everyone, welcome to True Crime News.


[00:02]
Let's get right to our top story. A


[00:05]
single mom heading to work in a Dallas


[00:07]
suburb gunned down while sitting in her


[00:10]
car. Police immediately circle in on a


[00:12]
suspect, but they would soon learn that


[00:14]
someone else helped to orchestrate the


[00:17]
plan. 24year-old Alyssa Berquette's


[00:20]
young life was only getting started. She


[00:23]
had a million-dollar smile and a heart


[00:24]
of gold. But despite that smile, her


[00:27]
grandfather telling Fox 4 in Dallas that


[00:30]
life wasn't very easy. She was a new


[00:33]
mother and that changes her like it


[00:35]
changes everyone.


[00:37]
The single mom was working her way


[00:39]
through the challenges of raising her


[00:41]
one-year-old daughter. Was enrolled in


[00:43]
college and was doing really well with


[00:45]
her studies. And she was working at this


[00:48]
apartment complex in a Dallas suburb to


[00:51]
help make ends meet.


[00:54]
But Alyssa was also living in fear.


[00:57]
Alyssa was coming to us saying, "I'm


[00:58]
afraid he's going to shoot me." He is


[01:01]
her ex-boyfriend and the father of their


[01:03]
daughter, Andrew Beard. Alyssa was in


[01:06]
the middle of a bitter custody battle,


[01:08]
and on a GoFundMe she set up to help


[01:11]
fight him in court, she wrote, "I am


[01:14]
scared for my life and my daughter's


[01:17]
life." Tragically, her biggest fear


[01:19]
would become a reality.


[01:22]
While sitting in her car in the


[01:24]
apartment parking lot where she worked,


[01:27]
Alyssa was shot in the head and stabbed


[01:30]
repeatedly to death. It was clear to our


[01:33]
detectives this was someone who was


[01:36]
hunting her. And someone else had seen a


[01:39]
man get out of an SUV and approach


[01:41]
Alyssa's car. We did have some witnesses


[01:45]
at the scene describe it as a black man,


[01:49]
but that did not mean by any means we


[01:52]
went looking for a black man. That's


[01:55]
because cops would eventually learn it


[01:58]
was all a ruse set up by Beard. He was


[02:02]
in disguise. And they were um


[02:04]
immediately sure it had to be him. When


[02:08]
police obtain a search warrant for


[02:10]
Beard's home, they find a long list of


[02:12]
evidence. Devices he used to track


[02:15]
Alyssa's car, trash bags and work boots,


[02:18]
some dark colored hair with blood on it,


[02:21]
makeup used to change his appearance,


[02:23]
and then a makeshift


[02:26]
silencer. This is video of Andrew Beard


[02:29]
being booked in a Dallas County jail. He


[02:32]
pleaded guilty to the murder and it all


[02:34]
seemed closed.


[02:38]
Much to the family's shock, there was


[02:40]
another


[02:41]
arrest. Beard's girlfriend, prosecutors


[02:45]
say Holly Elkins was the puppet master


[02:47]
of the entire plan to kill Alyssa and


[02:50]
they laid out the charges against her in


[02:53]
court. She wasn't an innocent bystander.


[02:55]
She participated in this all the way. I


[02:58]
think without her influence, Andrew


[02:59]
would not have committed the murder. At


[03:02]
trial, prosecutors say Elkins stalked


[03:05]
and harassed Alyssa for months. She and


[03:07]
Andrew planted drugs and a gun in her


[03:10]
car and called the police to have her


[03:12]
arrested so she could raise Alyssa's


[03:15]
daughter with


[03:16]
Andrew. When that didn't work, they


[03:19]
plotted to kill her. A week before


[03:23]
Alyssa's murder, Elkins sent text


[03:25]
messages to Beard saying, "I hope you'll


[03:27]
handle it." And that she'd be his ride


[03:30]
or die. No emotion at all. She didn't


[03:32]
have anything. I don't even know if she


[03:35]
bleed. A jury found Elkins guilty of


[03:37]
orchestrating Alyssa's murder. In


[03:40]
August, she was sentenced to two


[03:42]
consecutive life sentences behind bars.


[03:44]
Andrew Beard was sentenced to 43 years.


[03:48]
Overwhelming emotions cuz finally,


[03:51]
finally, this has been a long time


[03:52]
coming. Outside of court, Teresa Collard


[03:55]
hugged family and friends after justice


[03:57]
was finally delivered for her daughter.


[04:00]
I've been going to that grave site since


[04:02]
day one telling her justice is going to


[04:04]
be


[04:05]
[Music]


[04:07]
served. It is now almost 5 years to the


[04:10]
day that Alyssa was killed. Alyssa's


[04:12]
family says that they are happy that


[04:13]
they finally got justice, but that it is


[04:16]
bittersweet because nothing can bring


[04:18]
Alyssa back. They are raising her


[04:20]
daughter, and they say they try to keep


[04:22]
Alyssa's memory alive by reminding her


[04:24]
every day who her mother was. Now we


[04:27]
turn to a trial that is making


[04:29]
international headlines and has rocked


[04:31]
France. Jazelle Pelico bravely showing


[04:34]
up in court to testify after discovering


[04:37]
her former husband of 50 years had been


[04:40]
secretly drugging, raping her, and then


[04:43]
recording it. He admitted to it. Even


[04:45]
more disgusting, he allowed other men to


[04:47]
rape her. At least 83 other men were


[04:50]
recorded assaulting her as she lay


[04:52]
unconscious. It is a case that bears


[04:55]
eerie similarities to our next story.


[04:57]
Mandy Borman woke up one morning tasting


[05:00]
half-dissolved pills in her mouth. She


[05:02]
would soon find out that her husband was


[05:04]
betraying her and recording his


[05:07]
crimes. It's early morning and Mandy


[05:10]
Boardman wakes up to an unexplained and


[05:12]
strange feeling. I felt like maybe I had


[05:16]
sex the night before, but I knew that I


[05:18]
didn't because I didn't remember it. But


[05:20]
she's never had sex with her husband.


[05:22]
that was so forgettable. A lot of the


[05:25]
times I I truly thought I was crazy. I


[05:27]
thought I was losing my mind. Mandy's


[05:29]
nightmare will become one of the most


[05:31]
controversial cases a jury has ever had


[05:34]
to


[05:37]
decide. The young Indianapolis, Indiana


[05:39]
mom had been happily married to David


[05:41]
Weiss for 7 years. We were parents. We


[05:45]
were busy. You know, we were just


[05:46]
typical people, you know, living


[05:48]
everyday lives. Although the birth of


[05:50]
their two children took a little spark


[05:52]
out of their marriage, they were still


[05:54]
going strong.


[05:56]
We still had a sex life. We never


[05:59]
stopped. But Mandy is baffled when she


[06:01]
notices morning after signs of sex that


[06:04]
she can't remember having and that David


[06:07]
says never happened. He looked at me


[06:09]
like I was crazy. Mandy wonders, was she


[06:13]
just dreaming it all up? I was really


[06:15]
deeply confused. A worried Mandy


[06:18]
confides in her best friend and neighbor


[06:20]
Nicole Davis. She asked me, you know,


[06:22]
does that happen to you? Do you ever


[06:25]
just wake up and not remember going to


[06:27]
sleep? Not remember anything happening,


[06:30]
but felt like something happened. But


[06:33]
more strange signs start to appear. She


[06:36]
starts feeling tired all day as if she


[06:39]
had never slept at all. I would talk to


[06:41]
my mom. I'd talk to my friends. And it


[06:43]
would be like, "Well, you're a busy


[06:44]
woman. It's only natural that you get


[06:47]
tired. You're always on the go. And I


[06:49]
went with that, but I still thought it


[06:50]
was strange. I still thought something


[06:52]
has to be wrong. Then Nicole drops in on


[06:56]
Mandy one afternoon to find her in an


[06:59]
alarming


[07:00]
condition. She was on the couch kind of


[07:04]
drooling down her mouth. She was awake,


[07:07]
like coherent, but not really coherent.


[07:09]
like she knew I was talking to her, but


[07:11]
she all she could do was kind of roll


[07:12]
her eyes around and tell me she was


[07:13]
tired and she needed to take a nap.


[07:17]
Mandy knew it wasn't drugs or alcohol


[07:19]
because she didn't drink and party and


[07:22]
everything just kept getting stranger.


[07:25]
One night I woke up in the middle of the


[07:26]
night and I found a dissolving pill in


[07:28]
my mouth and I thought to myself, "Wow,


[07:31]
how in the world can I get up and I take


[07:33]
medicine and not swallow it?" Her memory


[07:36]
slipping, Mandy grows increasingly


[07:38]
concerned about her mental health. Here


[07:40]
I am tired all day. I'm forgetful and


[07:43]
now I'm taking pills in the middle of


[07:44]
the night and forgetting to swallow


[07:45]
them. But Mandy's hubby seems oddly


[07:48]
unconcerned. David never really had


[07:51]
anything to say about it. And Mandy will


[07:54]
soon learn why. I am starting to put the


[07:57]
pieces together now. I ended up waking


[07:59]
up in the middle of the night and


[08:00]
finding my husband over me with a


[08:02]
flashlight.


[08:04]
Mandy Borman was just desperate for a


[08:06]
good night's sleep. But suddenly, she is


[08:09]
awakened to a flashlight in her face and


[08:12]
her own husband lurking above her. I'm


[08:15]
asking what's going on. I'm watching my


[08:16]
husband run from my side of the bed over


[08:19]
to his side of the bed. I go over there


[08:20]
and I see him stuffing something under


[08:22]
the mattress. What's under the mattress?


[08:24]
Nothing. What's under the mattress?


[08:25]
Nothing. I'm going to get what's under


[08:26]
the mattress. So, I go for it. We had a


[08:29]
little physical toss. Eventually, I got


[08:31]
what was under the mattress. I look at


[08:34]
it and there was a vial and an eyropper.


[08:37]
And I'm like, "What is this?" Nothing.


[08:39]
No, you had this. What is this? You're


[08:41]
trying to hide this. What is it? And he


[08:43]
just tells me, he's like, "It's


[08:45]
Xanax." He's like, "I'm giving it to


[08:47]
you." And I'm like, "Why?" He's like, "I


[08:49]
feel like you need sleep. You won't take


[08:51]
it, so I'm giving it to you." Right


[08:53]
there in the couple's bedroom, the whole


[08:55]
ugly picture is coming into focus.


[08:59]
After I find the vial, I start noticing


[09:01]
things. Cuz there were a couple times


[09:02]
that I would open up a new soda. I'd set


[09:05]
it down. I'd walk away. I'd come back.


[09:07]
I'd take a drink and it would taste


[09:08]
different. I asked him, I was like,


[09:10]
"What'd you do?" And he's like,


[09:10]
"Nothing." I was like, "Did you put


[09:12]
something in my soda?" And he's like,


[09:13]
"No, I didn't." I was like, "Then you


[09:15]
drink it."


[09:17]
David refuses. And that's all Mandy


[09:20]
needs to know. But Mandy has no idea how


[09:23]
deep David's evil deeds really go until


[09:27]
he forgets to take his cell phone to


[09:29]
work. So, I decide to look at his phone.


[09:31]
the worst things I've ever seen. On the


[09:33]
phone screen, she finds three X-rated


[09:36]
videos of David raping her while she's


[09:40]
in a deep sleep, induced by pills that


[09:43]
he has been secretly feeding


[09:45]
her. I was devastated. I was disgusted.


[09:49]
I spent 12 years with this man and given


[09:51]
him every bit of trust I ever had. He


[09:54]
was supposed to take care of me. He was


[09:55]
supposed to protect me. There's no way


[09:57]
that he's actually violating me and


[09:58]
recording it. Mandy immediately files


[10:01]
for divorce and reports David to


[10:03]
Indianapolis police in an extremely rare


[10:07]
case. He is charged with raping his wife


[10:10]
under laws that have been in place in


[10:12]
all 50 states since the early


[10:15]
90s. At court, the videotapes are a key


[10:18]
piece of evidence convincing a jury to


[10:20]
convict him of rape and five counts of


[10:23]
criminal deviant conduct. We get the


[10:26]
guilty verdict and I am free. finally


[10:29]
like this man is gone. He's going to be


[10:32]
imprisoned.


[10:34]
David faces six to 20 years on each of


[10:36]
those counts. But when sentencing day


[10:39]
arrives, Mandy Boardman says the words


[10:41]
out of Judge Curt Eyes Grouper's mouth


[10:44]
had her feeling assaulted all over


[10:46]
again. I sat there and was done. How?


[10:52]
What? Instead of a possible 120 years


[10:56]
behind bars, the judge sentences David


[10:59]
to only house arrest. I don't understand


[11:03]
how you could let him walk out the door


[11:05]
with me. What? Sending someone to their


[11:09]
home to serve out a sentence is to me


[11:12]
just completely inappropriate when you


[11:13]
consider the home is where she was


[11:16]
victimized.


[11:18]
And Judge Kurt Eyes Grouper adds insult


[11:21]
to injury when he tells Mandy her


[11:24]
husband may have been quote a terrible


[11:27]
husband, but that he's a loving father


[11:30]
and she should work toward forgiveness.


[11:33]
I'm still to this day baffled that those


[11:36]
words came out of the judge's mouth. I


[11:38]
could not believe my ears when I heard


[11:40]
it. I thought the man's insane. He was


[11:42]
just flat out insane for doing that. I


[11:45]
felt like he thinks of marital rape like


[11:48]
a lot of people think of marital rape


[11:50]
that it's okay and that's not real rape.


[11:53]
Judge Kurt Eisruper declined to comment


[11:56]
on the


[11:57]
sentence. Prosecutor Courtney Curtis


[12:00]
believes the judge's opinion reflects


[12:03]
society's attitude toward marital rape.


[12:06]
I think there's an unwillingness to


[12:07]
accept that it is as bad as other forms


[12:11]
of rape. It is something that no wife or


[12:15]
woman should ever have happen to them.


[12:18]
But the judge's decision would be called


[12:20]
into question again after David Wise


[12:23]
violated the terms of his house arrest


[12:25]
and eventually spent a year in


[12:28]
jail. And later he was arrested again


[12:31]
for yet another crime. This time, cops


[12:34]
busted David for using his phone to


[12:37]
secretly record unsuspecting victims in


[12:40]
the restroom at a grocery store where he


[12:43]
worked. He faced multiple counts, but


[12:45]
struck a deal and pleaded guilty to a


[12:47]
single voyerism charge. He served about


[12:50]
5 years and was released and is now a


[12:53]
registered sex offender. Mandy is now


[12:56]
remarried with the new last name of


[12:58]
Pond, but she's still skeptical that any


[13:01]
of her nightmare will ever


[13:04]
end. Joining us now is Mandy Pond.


[13:07]
Mandy, I am still so angry by the fact


[13:11]
that your ex-husband was convicted of


[13:13]
these violent, violent assaults on you


[13:16]
and did not spend one day in prison as


[13:19]
part of his sentence. No, he did not. It


[13:22]
was very upsetting that day when he was


[13:25]
sentenced to find out that he was in


[13:27]
fact going home and he would not be


[13:29]
spending any time in jail. So, do you


[13:31]
believe because of that leniency and


[13:34]
complete disregard for you in this case


[13:37]
that that made it possible for him to


[13:39]
continue on with his crimes? It


[13:41]
absolutely did. It set a precedent in


[13:43]
the very beginning when he didn't have


[13:45]
to go to prison. He got off and that was


[13:48]
in his mind a get out of jail free card


[13:51]
and he continued to do what he did as a


[13:54]
result of that voyerism case. Then the


[13:56]
sentencing part of the case involving


[13:59]
you then is updated or changed. What


[14:02]
happened there? So what happened with


[14:03]
the voyerism charges and the sentencing


[14:06]
was he would plead guilty to his


[14:08]
voyerism charges. He got the time served


[14:11]
while he was in prison waiting on those


[14:13]
charges to come to because he violated


[14:16]
his probation parole. He was then


[14:19]
brought back to the charges from my case


[14:22]
which then at that point the judge was


[14:24]
forced to give him the suspended


[14:26]
sentence that he received and he had to


[14:28]
serve that time. Mandy, was there a


[14:30]
little bit of sweet justice in here?


[14:32]
There was definitely some sweet justice


[14:34]
when it came to him getting the jail


[14:36]
time from my case because it was in fact


[14:39]
the judge that had slapped him on the


[14:40]
wrists many years before. Your


[14:42]
ex-husband is now technically a free man


[14:45]
even though he's a registered sex


[14:47]
offender. How does that impact your


[14:49]
life? Wow. It's been scary honestly. And


[14:52]
not only is he a registered sex


[14:54]
offender, he is registered as a violent


[14:56]
sexual predator. And it is very scary


[15:00]
knowing that he is out and about and I


[15:03]
could run into him at any time and it's


[15:06]
not a comfortable feeling at all. Mandy,


[15:08]
thank you so much for joining us today.


[15:10]
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
