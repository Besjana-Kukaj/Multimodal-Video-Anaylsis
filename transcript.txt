[00:00]
hello world my name is Professor David J


[00:02]
malen I teach computer science at


[00:03]
Harvard and I'm here today to answer


[00:05]
your questions from Twitter this is


[00:07]
computer science support


[00:09]
[Music]


[00:12]
first up from Tad proletarian how do


[00:15]
search engines work so fast well the


[00:17]
short answer really is distributed


[00:19]
computing which is to say that Google


[00:21]
and Bing and other such search engines


[00:24]
they don't just have one server and they


[00:25]
don't even have just one really big


[00:27]
server rather they have hundreds


[00:28]
thousands probably hundreds of thousands


[00:31]
or more servers nowadays around the


[00:33]
world and so when you and I go in O2


[00:35]
Google or Bing and maybe type in a word


[00:37]
to search for like cat it's quite


[00:40]
possible that when you hit enter and


[00:42]
that keyword like cats is sent over the


[00:44]
internet to Google or to Bing it's


[00:46]
actually spread out ultimately across


[00:48]
multiple servers some of which are


[00:50]
grabbing the first 10 results some of


[00:51]
which are grabbing the next 10 results


[00:52]
the next 10 results so that you see just


[00:55]
one collection of results but a lot of


[00:57]
those ideas a lot of those search


[00:58]
results came from different places and


[01:00]
this eliminates what could potentially


[01:02]
be a bottleneck of sorts if all of the


[01:04]
information you needed had to come from


[01:06]
one specific server that might very well


[01:08]
be busy when you have that question Nick


[01:10]
asks will computer programming jobs to


[01:13]
be taken over by AI within the next five


[01:15]
to ten years this is such a frequently


[01:17]
Asked question nowadays and I don't


[01:18]
think the answer will be yes and I think


[01:20]
we've seen evidence of this already in


[01:22]
that early on when people were creating


[01:24]
websites they were literally writing out


[01:25]
code in a language called HTML by hand


[01:28]
but then of course software came along


[01:29]
tools like Dreamweaver that you could


[01:31]
download on your own computer that would


[01:32]
generate some of that same code for you


[01:34]
more recently though now you can just


[01:35]
sign up for websites like Squarespace


[01:37]
and Wix and others whereby click click


[01:39]
click and the website is generated for


[01:41]
you so I dare say certainly in some


[01:43]
domains that AI is really just an


[01:45]
evolution of that Trend and it hasn't


[01:47]
put humans out of business as much as it


[01:49]
has made you and I much more productive


[01:51]
AI I think and the ability soon to be


[01:54]
able to program with natural language is


[01:56]
just going to enhance what you and I can


[01:58]
already do logically but much more


[02:00]
mechanically and I think too it's worth


[02:01]
considering that there's just so many


[02:03]
bugs or mistakes in software in the


[02:05]
world and there's so many features that


[02:07]
humans wish existed in products present


[02:09]
and future that are to-do list so to


[02:11]
speak is way longer than will ever have


[02:13]
time to finish in our lifetimes and so I


[02:16]
think the prospect to having an


[02:17]
artificial intelligence boost our


[02:19]
productivity and work alongside us so to


[02:22]
speak as we try to solve problems is


[02:24]
just going to mean that you and I and


[02:25]
the world together can solve so many


[02:27]
more problems and move forward together


[02:29]
at an even faster rate all right next up


[02:32]
Sophia who asks how do microchips even


[02:34]
work it's just a green piece of metal


[02:36]
well here for instance we have a whole


[02:39]
bunch of microchips on what's called a


[02:40]
logic board or sometimes known as a


[02:42]
motherboard there's a lot of ports that


[02:44]
you might be familiar with for instance


[02:45]
like here are some ports for audio here


[02:47]
are some ports for networking here's


[02:49]
some ports for USB and some other


[02:51]
devices as well and those ports


[02:52]
meanwhile are connected to lots of


[02:54]
different chips on this board that know


[02:56]
how to interpret the signals from those


[02:58]
ports and perhaps the biggest chip on


[03:00]
this motherboard tends to be this thing


[03:02]
here called the CPU or the central


[03:03]
processing unit which is really the


[03:05]
brains of the computer and what you


[03:07]
can't necessarily quite see because most


[03:08]
of this is actually paint and not traces


[03:10]
but if I flip this around you'll


[03:12]
actually see in the right light and with


[03:14]
the right angle a whole bunch of traces


[03:16]
running up down left and right on this


[03:18]
logic board that's connecting all of


[03:20]
these various microchips and by Trace I


[03:22]
mean a tiny little wire that's been


[03:24]
etched into the top or the bottom of


[03:26]
this circuit board that connects two


[03:27]
parts thereon now what might these


[03:29]
microchips be doing well again they


[03:30]
might be simply interpreting signals


[03:32]
that are coming in from these ports two


[03:34]
they might be performing mathematical


[03:35]
operations doing something with those


[03:37]
signals in order to convert input into


[03:39]
output or they might just be storing


[03:41]
information ultimately in fact there's


[03:43]
all different types of memory on a logic


[03:45]
board like this be it Ram or ROM or the


[03:47]
like and so some of those chips might


[03:49]
very well be storing information for as


[03:51]
long as the computer is plugged in or in


[03:53]
some cases depending on the device even


[03:55]
when the power goes off alright next a


[03:57]
question from nkhe so if anyone can


[03:59]
learn coding what do computer scientists


[04:01]
do for four years in University


[04:03]
typically in an undergraduate program in


[04:05]
computer science or computer engineering


[04:07]
or a similar field someone spends much


[04:10]
more time learning about the field


[04:12]
itself than about programming


[04:13]
specifically so as such you might study


[04:15]
not only a bit of programming but also


[04:17]
mathematics certain fundamentals that


[04:19]
transcend the particular classes you


[04:21]
might have taken in middle school or


[04:22]
high school but that can be used to


[04:24]
solve Grand or real world problems you


[04:26]
might learn something about networks how


[04:28]
you can send information from point A to


[04:29]
point B you might learn about Graphics


[04:31]
how you can display things on the screen


[04:33]
or even create interactive animations or


[04:35]
the like you might learn how to leverage


[04:37]
certain ideas from mathematics and other


[04:39]
fields to implement your very own


[04:40]
artificial intelligence nowadays whereby


[04:43]
you use probability and statistics and


[04:46]
information more generally to try to


[04:47]
predict what a intelligent individual or


[04:50]
in this case computer might say in


[04:52]
response to a question so computer it's


[04:54]
science itself is a very broad field and


[04:56]
programming is really just a tool that


[04:58]
you tend to learn along the way from


[05:00]
Maya Shelby how do zeros and ones turn


[05:03]
into the internet well I think the


[05:05]
simplest answer there is that the


[05:07]
internet is built upon layers and layers


[05:09]
and layers of ideas and if we start at


[05:11]
the lowest of those levels zeros and


[05:13]
ones you have something called binary


[05:14]
where zeros and ones can be used to


[05:16]
represent any other numbers as well and


[05:18]
if we use more and more zeros and ones


[05:20]
more and more binary digits or bits so


[05:22]
to speak we can count up higher and


[05:24]
higher and higher and then if you and I


[05:26]
agree that all right well let's not just


[05:27]
use these patterns of zeros and ones to


[05:29]
represent numbers what if we reserve


[05:31]
some of these patterns to represent


[05:33]
letters of like the English alphabet and


[05:35]
then maybe you and I can decide to


[05:36]
reserve certain patterns of zeros and


[05:38]
ones to represent colors like red and


[05:40]
green and blue in combinations thereof


[05:42]
well once we have the ability to


[05:44]
represent colors we could then represent


[05:46]
whole pictures because what's a picture


[05:48]
on your phone or a computer screen well


[05:50]
it's really just a grid of dots Each of


[05:52]
which has its own color so this is all


[05:54]
to say that even if we start at this


[05:55]
lowest level of just zeros and ones so


[05:58]
long as you and I and all of the devices


[06:00]
we use agree to follow some standard


[06:02]
like this we can build these layers and


[06:04]
layers of abstraction so to speak on top


[06:06]
of one another until finally you and I


[06:09]
come up with a pattern of zeros and ones


[06:10]
that represents send this piece of of


[06:12]
information from me over there and thus


[06:15]
we have something like the internet


[06:17]
Majin Buu asks can someone that knows


[06:19]
computer science explain to me why


[06:21]
computers use binary coding and not


[06:23]
trinary when trinary is supposed to be


[06:25]
faster so it's not necessarily the case


[06:27]
that a trinary system which would use


[06:29]
three symbols for instance zero one and


[06:31]
two would necessarily be faster than


[06:33]
binary because binary using just zero


[06:36]
and one tends to be simpler to implement


[06:38]
and also more robust to potential errors


[06:40]
or if you're familiar with voltage


[06:42]
levels like in a battery it's very easy


[06:44]
for a computer to distinguish something


[06:45]
for like zero volts or three volts but


[06:48]
it gets a little harder if we try to


[06:50]
draw the line somewhere in between


[06:51]
because there's just a higher


[06:52]
probability that a computer might


[06:54]
mistake a a voltage level like 1.5 in


[06:57]
the middle is maybe being a little


[06:58]
closer to off than on or to on than off


[07:02]
here too is where even though there


[07:03]
might be mathematical efficiencies in


[07:05]
real world efficiencies to using trinary


[07:07]
otherwise known as ternary like a zero a


[07:10]
one and a two digit instead of just


[07:12]
zeros and ones it turns out because our


[07:14]
world runs on electricity nowadays and


[07:16]
there's so much momentum behind binary


[07:17]
that it just tends to be a net positive


[07:20]
Rachel P95 asks why is every Windows


[07:23]
solution have you tried restarting and


[07:25]
why does that always work so that's a


[07:27]
very heavy-handed solution to what are


[07:29]
typically just bugs or mistakes in


[07:31]
software for instance windows in this


[07:33]
case restarting a computer just starts


[07:35]
everything from scratch so all of the


[07:37]
computers short-term memory is lost and


[07:39]
everything starts in pristine condition


[07:40]
which is to say that it starts in


[07:42]
exactly the way that the programmers at


[07:44]
Microsoft intended without potentially


[07:46]
the distractions of the computer being


[07:47]
in some weird state or condition that


[07:49]
the programmers just didn't anticipate


[07:51]
maybe you clicked on some buttons in a


[07:53]
weird order maybe you opened a strange


[07:54]
file but you maybe you got the computer


[07:56]
into a state that just wasn't programmed


[07:58]
for properly Jason Whitmer now asks


[08:00]
what's the best operating system well


[08:02]
this is one of these questions in


[08:03]
Computing we would call a religious


[08:05]
question since it evokes a religious


[08:07]
debate as to which might be best of


[08:08]
course among the most popular operating


[08:10]
systems out there are windows and Mac OS


[08:13]
but there's also one you might not have


[08:14]
heard of which is called Linux which is


[08:16]
actually very omnipresent in the


[08:18]
Enterprise world so many of today's


[08:19]
servers actually run Linux so many of


[08:21]
today's desktops or laptops though run


[08:23]
Windows or Mac OS now that's not to say


[08:26]
you couldn't run all of those operating


[08:27]
systems in different contexts and some


[08:29]
of us do actually run Linux on our own


[08:31]
computers so a lot of it is really boils


[08:33]
down to personal preference I wouldn't


[08:35]
even say that there's one best operating


[08:37]
system but there tend to be correlations


[08:39]
between the operating systems people use


[08:41]
and the applications they have in mind


[08:42]
so windows for instance is so popular in


[08:45]
the world of PCS and desktops and


[08:46]
laptops Mac OS is to some extent


[08:48]
particularly in Academia in certain


[08:50]
countries but not necessarily on the


[08:52]
same scale Linux by contrast is again


[08:54]
very much used heavily in the


[08:56]
server-side industry but so is Windows


[08:58]
as well so a lot of the choice for


[09:00]
operating systems sometimes comes from


[09:02]
just what's most appropriate what's most


[09:04]
popular what's most supportive but some


[09:05]
of it comes too from just personal


[09:07]
preference of the engineer maybe the


[09:08]
first engineer that you hire to make one


[09:10]
of those decisions so it's more about


[09:12]
what what's best for you and not so much


[09:14]
best in general next Julio magnifico


[09:17]
asks why aren't computers getting


[09:18]
cheaper well computers or at least


[09:20]
computer parts inside of computers do


[09:23]
tend to get cheaper the catch is that


[09:25]
your expectations and my expectations


[09:27]
just keep Rising we want our phones our


[09:29]
laptops our desktops to do more and more


[09:31]
in the way of the software that they run


[09:33]
the games that we use and just how


[09:35]
quickly they perform for us so even


[09:37]
though some of those parts are getting


[09:38]
less expensive you and I want them to do


[09:41]
more and more and be faster and larger


[09:43]
in quantity and so as a result I dare


[09:45]
say that the price isn't going down as


[09:47]
far as you might hope that said nowadays


[09:49]
you can get for the same amount of money


[09:51]
from yesteryear much much more in the


[09:54]
way of computing power so arguably it's


[09:56]
working to our benefit in some cases


[09:58]
next up from Darrow nabila can someone


[10:01]
explain cloud computing to me like a


[10:03]
five-year-old cloud computing is


[10:04]
essentially you using someone else's


[10:06]
servers that someone is paying to rent


[10:09]
for instance or timeshare so this isn't


[10:11]
really a new idea or or new technology


[10:13]
rather it's a better branding of a


[10:15]
technique that's been used for years not


[10:16]
just in the computer world but in the


[10:18]
real world as well whereby someone like


[10:19]
Google or Microsoft or apple or others


[10:21]
nowadays might be able to afford lots


[10:24]
and lots and lots of servers and then


[10:25]
make those servers available in part to


[10:27]
me to you and many other customers as


[10:30]
well hey I'm Marcus hey Marcus well


[10:32]
Marcus asks how does computer memory


[10:34]
work think of computer memory as really


[10:37]
being driven by a whole bunch of


[10:38]
switches that can either be turned on


[10:39]
and off so for instance if I take this


[10:42]
here light switch which is currently off


[10:44]
I could simply say that this switch here


[10:46]
is representing the number zero in


[10:48]
binary but if I turn the switch on well


[10:50]
now I can say that I'm representing the


[10:52]
number one now of course I can only


[10:54]
count as high as 0 to 1 with a single


[10:57]
light switch but what if I bring over a


[10:59]
second light switch like this one here


[11:01]
if we start at zero in this way turn on


[11:04]
this switch first and claim that it's


[11:06]
one let me now be more creative and turn


[11:09]
this one off and this one on and now


[11:11]
claim this is how how a computer's


[11:13]
memory could represent the number two


[11:14]
and now if I turn this switch back on


[11:16]
giving me a fourth pattern this is how I


[11:19]
might represent the number three now of


[11:21]
course if we add more and more of these


[11:22]
switches more and more of these light


[11:24]
bulbs we can count even higher than


[11:26]
three and indeed that's what a


[11:27]
computer's memory is ultimately doing


[11:29]
it's using lots and lots of little tiny


[11:32]
switches otherwise known as transistors


[11:34]
to turn the flow of electricity on and


[11:36]
off and then it's got other types of


[11:37]
Hardware called for instance capacitors


[11:40]
that have a capacity to hold on to some


[11:42]
of that electricity just like the light


[11:44]
bulb there being on all right next


[11:46]
Donnie asks how do you explain web 3 to


[11:49]
people so web3 like web 2 and


[11:52]
retrospectively web one or really just


[11:54]
buzzwords that describe sort of phases


[11:56]
of the internet or the World Wide Web as


[11:58]
you and I know it for instance back in


[12:00]
the day when there was just the World


[12:01]
Wide Web now perhaps referred to as web


[12:04]
version one information was largely


[12:06]
static if you were to create a website


[12:08]
on the internet you would type up your


[12:10]
code you would type up your content you


[12:11]
would put it on a server somewhere and


[12:13]
someone could read that information but


[12:16]
it was you the web developer or you the


[12:19]
owner of the website that was creating


[12:20]
that content for other people to


[12:22]
actually read and consume in web 2 the


[12:24]
world became much more dynamic in recent


[12:27]
years whereby now websites tend to have


[12:29]
databases and they have more


[12:31]
sophistication so that a lot of the


[12:33]
content in websites today are actually


[12:35]
coming from me and from you so if you


[12:37]
think of any social media site it's not


[12:39]
the owners of those sites that are


[12:40]
creating most of the content it's you


[12:42]
and me as the users of those same


[12:44]
websites but in web 2 everything is


[12:46]
nonetheless very centralized whether


[12:48]
you're Twitter or Facebook now meta or


[12:50]
other companies all of that data even in


[12:52]
the world of social media that's coming


[12:54]
from me and you is actually being stored


[12:56]
centrally on those company servers so


[12:58]
web 3.0 or web 3 so to speak is really


[13:02]
about transitioning away potentially


[13:04]
from that very centralized model to one


[13:06]
that's more distributed where the data


[13:08]
that you and I are creating whereby the


[13:10]
data you and I are consuming is actually


[13:12]
distributed over multiple servers over a


[13:15]
technique called blockchain for instance


[13:17]
in some cases whereby there's not


[13:19]
necessarily one owner of that data but


[13:21]
really Collective ownership and


[13:23]
therefore verification that the data


[13:25]
Maybe indeed came from me and you next a


[13:29]
question from gomo tigers can someone


[13:30]
explain to me the difference between


[13:32]
firmware and software Hardware is


[13:34]
physical software is code WTF is


[13:37]
firmware firmware is really a synonym


[13:39]
for a type of software so firmware is


[13:41]
just software but it tends to be


[13:43]
software that comes built into your


[13:46]
hardware and you can think of in the


[13:48]
simplest scenario that firmware is


[13:49]
software that is just completely


[13:51]
integrated into the hardware and itself


[13:53]
cannot be changed or even upgraded but


[13:55]
that's a bit of an oversimplification


[13:57]
because even firmware typically when it


[13:59]
comes in a computer when it comes in a


[14:01]
phone or some other device can very


[14:03]
often be updated why because the


[14:05]
firmware is the software that's really


[14:06]
closest to the hardware and in that


[14:08]
sense it might very well be the most


[14:09]
important and if anything goes wrong


[14:11]
with The Firm where you might not even


[14:12]
be able to turn that device on whether


[14:14]
it's a phone or computer or even your


[14:16]
refrigerator nowadays alright that's all


[14:18]
the questions for today we hoped you


[14:19]
learned a little something along the way


[14:21]
we'll see you next time


[14:22]
